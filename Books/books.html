			                    	* Second book for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shapersthimphu"> Global Shapers Thimphu Hub </a> Book club. *<br>
			                   		Other than the student experiments and anecdotes, I found a lot of the stories and advice in the book doesn't capture the various complexities of life that determine what you can do. I do agree with Tina Seelig that you make your own luck, but you also have to be aware of your privileges that help incline luck towards you. For instance, socioeconomic status plays a huge role in being able to take risk and venture into the unknown. However, there is no mention of it anywhere in the book. At times, the ideas in the book felt a little geared towards western and in particular white population. Nonetheless, the book has insightful ideas to practice in everyday life.

			                   		<p>
			                   			During my college years and even to this day, I have a tendency of seeing what someone needs and check if I have the skills and requirements to fulfill that. However, after reading this book, I have realized that you have to show people what you can offer, not what check boxes you fulfill.

			                   			In one of the stories, each student group had to generate as much money as they could from the initial $5 seed money in 2 hours. They then had 3 minutes to present on their idea and implementation the week after. The winning team had completely ignored the $5 and actually sold their 3 minute presentation time to advertise for a company that wanted to recruit students in the class. This was the first and the most powerful story in the book. It taught me to look beyond the noise. I would have been scratching my head to come up with an idea that uses the $5.

			                   		Why do some nations prosper while some are poor and often on the brink of collapse? According to Acemoglu and Robinson, a nation’s prosperity is all due to  inclusive political and economic institutions. A political institution is inclusive if it is pluralistic (power is not in the hands of a few) and centralized (government having enough power to uphold law and order). Economic institution is said to be inclusive if there are strong property rights law, unbiased law and order and a level playing field for everyone. Extractive institutions on the other side are where power is in the hands of few and policies are geared towards their gains. 
			                   	</p>
			                   	<p class="new-review-content">
									Although an easy read, the idea of extractive and inclusive institutions gets a little repetitive after a while. One of the biggest criticisms of the book  would be the treatment of  inclusive and extractive institutions as the one and only factor for a state of the nation. The authors fail to even acknowledge other factors like globalization. Additionally, the final chapter of the book is a major letdown given that there is no concrete idea/process for how an inclusive institution can be built or how countries can transition to it. 
								</p>
								<p class="new-review-content">
									<b><i>Side Thought:</i></b><br>
									In Bhutan, our kings have worked tirelessly to empower Bhutanese people. Contrary to the norm, our monarchy system was the furthest from an extractive institution. However, while reading the book, it occured to me that the few wealthy elites were constantly undermining their majesties' work by bending the rule of law for their gains. Given that, was the Bhutanese government and institutions really  inclusive? I use past tense because now Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy and power and influence doesn't necessarily work the same way it used to. However, this does not mean that the government and institutions have become more inclusive but rather a simple fact that I was away for six years and don't necessarily know how things are running.

		                   		The Biggest Bluff is Konnikova’s journey from an amateur player to winning tournaments, self-realization and life lessons along the way. Maria Konnikova, a writer with a PhD in psychology and zero experience with gambling  pursues professional poker to explore the uncertain realm of decision-making. Unlike roulette and chess where one is of pure chance and the other is of pure skill with complete information, poker is more like life, uncertain with incomplete information. Just as life, poker is about making the best decision with what you know (your cards), what everyone knows (community cards) and what you can guess of (opponent’s card). Throughout the book, Konnikova draws several parallels between life and poker which sheds light on how we think, act and decide.

                    <p class="new-review-content">
                      Given that my first introduction to Norse mythology was Marvel movie Thor, I looked at Norse gods in a different light than this
                      book paints. For instance, I have always assumed and seen Thor as a righteous, do no harm kinda guy, but he isn’t completely
                      like that. The gods aren’t as mighty and sanctimonious as they are portrayed in movies. For instance, in one story, the gods are
                      convinced by Loki to bet a giant to build a wall big enough to surround Asgard. If the giant  builds it within a certain time frame, he
                      wins the most beautiful princess in Asgard, otherwise nothing.
                      On the last day of the wall completion, the gods (even Odin) are euphoric, when Loki cheats the giant by luring the giant’s horse and
                      leaving the giant unable to complete the wall. Such stories paint a vastly contrasting picture of the Norse gods to
                      what I had assumed.
                      <br><br>
                      All in all, this is a very easy and delightful read. The short stories did feel a little disconnected from each other at
                      times, but it nonetheless shows the full spectrum of the god’s actions.

                        This book is the scientific answer to all the cool stuff that happens in science-fiction movies and things
                        that I wish I had all
                        the time. From time travel, teleportation to invisibility, UFOs and many more, Michio Kaku explores the
                        “impossibility” of today
                        becoming a reality tomorrow. Each chapter is about one current “impossibility” which falls under three
                        categories of
                        impossibilities: class 1, class 2 and class 3.
                        <ul>
                          <li> Class 1 impossibility: technologies that are impossible today but do not violate the known laws of
                            physics. </li>
                          <li>Class 2 impossibility: technologies that sit at the very edge of our understanding of the physical
                            world. </li>
                          <li>Class 3 impossibility: technologies that violate the known laws of physics. </li>
                        </ul>
                        One of the biggest shocks for me came when perpetual motions was defined as a class 3 impossibility.
                        Teleportation, telepathy,
                        time travel or moving faster than light doesn’t break the laws of physics and yet a simple perpetual
                        machine is either truly
                        impossible or would have to change everything about physics and how we know the world.

                        This is definitely one of my favourite books so far and I highly recommend anyone (especially highschool
                        students) to give it a
                        read.

                          The returns on capital or wealth as Piketty uses interchangeably grows at a higher rate compared to the
                          economic growth rate.
                          And given that income from capital is mostly concentrated in the top wealthy families, this phenomenon of
                          <b>r > g</b> where
                          <b>r is the return on capital</b> and <b>g is the economic growth rate</b> is the root cause for
                          increasing inequality. This
                          is at the heart of the argument in the book.

                          Europe before the two world wars had inequality at level even higher than now. Piketty argues that due to
                          the world wars, most
                          capitals were destroyed and in the process and saw a huge decrease in inequality. However, now with
                          increased peace and
                          stability, inequality is growing at a pace that is about to reach or exceed the Belle Époque era. It will
                          be interesting to
                          see how the current Covid pandemic has affected earnings of people in different ladders of wealth. It has
                          definitely hit the
                          low incomes the hardest but how has it affected the top 1 percent or the top 10 percent. Jeff Bezos, the
                          world richest man has
                          seen an increase in his wealth during the pandemic while millions of people all around the globe are
                          losing their job and
                          their livelihood.
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Even if you collected $10 everyday since the big bang, Jeff Bezos will still be richer than you.

                            In his book, Frankopan argues that the economic center of gravity is shifting from the west to the east.
                            Decisions that really matter today in the world today are being made not in London , Berlin or Paris but
                            in Beijing,
                            Moscow, Tehran, Delhi and Islamabad that are on the silk road. However important and dominant the silk
                            road is in the
                            global economy, it is also a region riddled with conflicts, dictatorships and corruption which has left
                            the region as
                            fragile as it is important and dominant. One interesting fact from the book: “The principal shareholder in
                            the firm that
                            owns the Carrara marble quarries in Italy is the bin Laden family, which means the marble used in the
                            Freedom Tower in New
                            York City is quarried by the family of Osama bin-Laden, who engineered the destruction of the Twin Towers
                            that previously
                            stood on the same site on 9/11.”

                              out. When was the last time your disadvantages
                              actually served to be an advantage, this is the main thesis of the book. Disadvantages aren’t always bad,
                              sometimes they
                              are
                              your greatest asset. Just like any of his books, Malcolm Gladwell defends his claim through multiple
                              anecdotes which
                              slowly
                              loses its relevance to the topic as the book progresses. I am not sure if this is only me but the
                              stories/anecdotes in
                              later
                              chapters of the book becoming less and less relevant to the main topic seems like a trend in his books.

                              It is clear and partially understandable that most stories in his books are cherry-picked. However, it
                              becomes troublesome
                              when Gladwell makes a sweeping generalization based on these stories and decides to ignore other factors.
                              For instance,
                              the
                              early part of the book talks a lot about successful people with dyslexia. Gladwell makes the case that
                              dyslexia had a
                              major
                              role if not all in the success of these people and forgets to account for factors such as but not limited
                              to family
                              support
                              and race (since most stories are US-centric and race plays a huge role). All in all, the book serves as a
                              good reminder
                              that
                              drawbacks and failure can be a powerful tool to success in life.

                              These three books took me all the way from the 12th century to the 21st century. As
                              seen throughout history, these stories were filled with wars and bloodshed but ultimately it boiled down to
                              leadership,
                              especially
                              in times of crisis. The Mongol queens helped Genghis Khan build the largest contiguous land empire in
                              history. However,
                              weak
                              leadership marked by constant sibling rivalry after the death of Genghis Khan eventually led to the fall of
                              the empire.
                              Kohinoor,
                              the most infamous diamond was eventually lost to the British after the death of Ranjit Singh (Sikh emperor)
                              which was also
                              marked
                              with several political turmoil, coups, and assassinations. In Nepal, the most recent story of all the books,
                              the Maoist
                              party
                              gained its foothold (which eventually led to Maoist insurgency) due to the political unrest within the
                              “democratic
                              government
                              of
                              Nepal” and the trepidation of the Monarch taking control of the country. It was a complete coincidence, that
                              I read
                              ‘Democratic
                              Transition in Bhutan’ right before I read these three. The sharp contrast between the Bhutanese Monarchs and
                              the leaders
                              that
                              emerged in those three books is exactly why most Bhutanese love and worship our kings.
