# Watson
Given the convenience of hosting a static website in Github, I decided to use it as my portal for my Watson year. This is where I will be uploading all my blogs and videos and updates about my Watson year as well as myself. I also decided to use this so that I am forced to code in order to upload stuff to show the world. In this way, I donâ€™t end up not coding much during my Watson year.
