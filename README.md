# Watson
Given the convenience of hosting a static website on Github, I decided to use it as a portal to share my Watson year. This is where I will be uploading all my updates. I also decided to use this so that I am forced to code in order to upload things that I want to share. In this way, I donâ€™t end up without coding at all during my Watson year.
