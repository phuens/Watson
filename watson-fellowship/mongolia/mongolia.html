                <p>21st December - 10th March</p>
                <p>
                    It was -30 degree celsius when I first arrived in ulaanbaatar. The excitement and nervousness of
                    being in a new place, culture, work and most importantly new people had delayed my brain to register
                    the coldness. It was only the day after when I walked to work that I felt the coldness and my
                    eyelashes were freezing as I walked. And just like that with frozen eyelashes every
                    morning I started working with <a href="https://www.germapcenter.org/" target="_">Ger Community
                        Mapping Center </a>(GCMC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    GCMC is a small ngo that works to “ promotes community mapping as a planning, awareness and outreach
                    tool to advocate
                    for sustainable, participatory and eco-friendly solutions to address local urban problems.​​”
                    Although a small
                    organization with just three people, (Batdorj, Anu and Oogi, some of the loveliest people during my
                    whole Watson trip)
                    their work was paramount in aiding various government offices make data-driven decisions and hold
                    officials accountable.
                    My Watson journey was marked by working with such small but dauntless organizations bringing immense
                    positive change in
                    the society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time I reached Mongolia, GCMC had already carried out a full fledged project on insulating
                    houses. GCMC in
                    collaboration with another organization were not only raising awareness for house insulation but
                    also insulating the
                    houses at a subsidized cost. In order to further strengthen the case for house insulation, we
                    decided to 3D-heat map the
                    houses, both insulated and uninsulated to study the heat loss.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5 col-lg-5 col-sm-10 col-xs-10" style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="../../images/watson/thermal-house.png" style="width: 100%" />
                <p style="font-size:small;margin-top:10px"><i>Thermal image of the kindergarten</i></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8 col-lg-8 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 paragraph">
                <p> In order to generate the 3D-heat model of the houses, we flew a DJI Phantom (for the RGB images),
                    Matrice 200 with
                    Zenmuse XT2 (mostly for thermal images), DSLR, and a thermal camera. The idea was to create a RGB
                    based 3D-model and
                    either attach stitched thermal images on each side or entirely create a heat 3D-model if possible.
                    For the trial
                    project, we mapped a kindergarten school. Mapping a single building at a single location made the
                    work easier and
                    faster. However, once we examined the thermal images, we realized the temperature readings were
                    inaccurate. Temperature
                    readings especially through thermal cameras are more inaccurate during the day than night. However,
                    we couldn’t fly
                    drones at night given the numerous cable lines and the harsh cold winter of Ulaanbaatar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I was a little bummed about the heat mapping project not working out, we immediately
                    started another drone
                    mapping project. This time we would use drone mapping to study air,

                    water and soil pollution all at one go. Almost half of the population of the country are in
                    Ulaanbaatar. More than half
                    (51.3%) of those households in Ulaanbaatar live in the Ger area. This area is largely unplanned
                    peri-urban settlement
                    formed from intensive rural to urban migration. Due to the government considering “Ger area” as
                    informal temporary
                    settlement up until recently, the area lacks even the basic infrastructure systems such as water
                    supply, sewage and
                    district heating system.

                        What allows the study of pollution using drone mapping especially in these areas is because of
                        uniformity in house
                        sizes/design and detached toilet. This allows for easier detection, counting and studying of
                        buildings and toilets. This
                        would then be connected with the household survey data and the soil, water quality test data.

                    <p>
                        We started off with Gandan area, the oldest settlement in Ulaanbaatar. The whole mapping of the
                        area took us about two
                        days mostly because the drone batteries weren’t functioning at their maximum capacity due to the
                        cold. Given that there
                        were some tall buildings surrounding the area, at one point we couldn’t locate the drone in the
                        air and we were losing
                        the drone signal. So, what do we do? We just started running in the middle of the street trying
                        to get to a higher
                        elevation to regain signal. Mind you the whole time we were all wrapped in thick jackets and
                        pants while holding a bulky
                        controller and running with our eyes bewildered at the sky (people must have been definitely
                        confused seeing us).

                    This alone remains my favourite memory from Watson. Before I could see this project through, I had
                    to leave Mongolia immediately because of the US CDC travel warning (I had no choice but to abide by
                    it given my
                    fellowship was being sponsored by a US foundation). A few weeks after I left Mongolia, I was told
                    that one of the team
                    members from GCMC died. Although we couldn’t see the project to its completion, I am incredibly
                    grateful for the
                    opportunity to work with such amazing qualified people and getting to experience the Mongolian
                    culture and especially the
                    Lunar new year with one of my co-worker’s family.

                        None of this would have been remotely possible without the GCMC team. A big big thank you to
                        Anu,
                        Oogi, late Batdorj,
                        Batdorj’s wife and Anu’s friend and her boyfriend. Batdorj was a beautiful soul, an amazing
                        leader
                        and I am sure he is
                        in a better place now.
